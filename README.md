# ScamDetector - Scam Call Detection

## Overview
ScamDetector is an innovative cybersecurity tool designed to detect and prevent phone scams. By leveraging advanced AI and speech recognition technologies, it listens to phone calls and assesses the likelihood of a scam in real time. ScamDetector provides users with actionable insights, helping protect individuals, especially seniors, from falling victim to fraud.

## Features
- **Real-time Scam Detection:** Uses AI and speech recognition to evaluate the probability of scam calls.
- **AI-Powered Risk Scoring:** Assigns a "scam score" based on the likelihood of fraud, alerting users of potential risks.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive design that makes it easy to interact with the scam detection system.
- **Smart Algorithms:** Scans for common scam-related phrases and suspicious patterns to assess the call's legitimacy.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS, TailwindCSS, FramerMotion
- **Backend:** Flask
- **AI:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) for context-based scam detection
- **Speech Recognition:** Advanced technologies for analyzing call content in real time

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- Python and pip (for backend)
- Flask

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scamdetector.git
    cd scamdetector
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```



## How it Works
ScamDetector uses sophisticated algorithms to scan live phone conversations. By recognizing certain patterns and keywords associated with scams (such as "urgent" or "prize"), the system calculates a risk score. If a call is flagged as potentially fraudulent, users are alerted, enabling them to take action before falling victim to a scam.

## Roadmap
- **Multi-language Support:** Expanding ScamDetector's ability to recognize scams in various languages.
- **Expanded Scam Database:** Continuously updating our database with new scam patterns and tactics.
- **Integration with More Platforms:** Expanding support to work with additional communication platforms beyond phone calls.
